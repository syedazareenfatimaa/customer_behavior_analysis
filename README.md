# customer_behavior_analysis
This project analyzes customer shopping behavior using transactional data from 3,900 purchases across various product categories. The goal is to uncover insights into spending patterns, customer segments, product preferences, and subscription behavior to guide strategic business decisions.

# Data Analytics Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow, from raw data ingestion to business insights visualization. It covers data loading, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, SQL-based analysis, dashboard creation, and final reporting. The goal is to showcase practical data analytics skills using industry-relevant tools and best practices.

## Project Workflow / Steps

1. **Data Loading**

   * Imported the dataset into Python using Pandas.
   * Performed initial inspection to understand structure and data types.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   * Analyzed distributions, trends, and relationships.
   * Identified outliers, missing values, and anomalies using visualizations and summary statistics.

3. **Data Cleaning**

   * Handled missing and duplicate records.
   * Standardized formats and corrected data inconsistencies.
   * Prepared clean data for analysis and reporting.

4. **SQL Analysis (PostgreSQL)**

   * Loaded cleaned data into PostgreSQL.
   * Wrote SQL queries to extract insights and answer business questions.
   * Performed aggregations, joins, and filtering for deeper analysis.

5. **Dashboard Development**

   * Built an interactive Power BI dashboard.
   * Visualized key metrics, trends, and insights.
   * Designed with clarity and usability in mind.

6. **Reporting & Presentation**

   * Created a detailed project report summarizing methodology and findings.
   * Developed a professional presentation using Gamma to communicate insights effectively.
